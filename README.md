# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio

# Front-End
I built this portfolio with html, css and vanilla js, no frameworks, however to make my life easier and the development process faster, I used quite a few libraries including:

Highway.js + Gsap : Smooth page transitions
Typed.js : typing animation on home screen
Aos : Scroll animations

# Back-End
To manage the content in the "My Projects" Section I went for a lightweight low cost Headless CMS, StoryBlok offers a REST API to manage the content as well as an easy to use admin panel
